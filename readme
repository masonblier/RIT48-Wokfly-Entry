This was my (one person team) entry into RIT48 for 2011. Feel free to do what you like with it, but be warned it's not secure or the nicest. If you know a thing or two about node/express/mongo, let me know anything I can improve on. I got into this stack the day of the competition. It's a lot of fun to code with it.
